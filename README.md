# Insurance Cost Prediction Model

## Overview
In the insurance industry, accurate prediction of insurance premiums is crucial for fair pricing, risk management, and fraud prevention. This project develops an **Insurance Cost Prediction Model** using machine learning algorithms to estimate insurance costs based on key demographic and lifestyle factors. These factors include **age, BMI, smoking status, medical history, location, and family medical conditions**.

## Features
- Utilizes multiple machine learning models, including **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks**.
- Implements **feature engineering** techniques for optimal model training.
- Employs **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** for model interpretability and transparency.
- Provides **personalized premium estimates** to customers and enhances insurers' risk assessment mechanisms.
- Reduces underwriting errors through **data-driven analysis**.

## Prerequisites
### Software & Libraries
Ensure that you have the following software and libraries installed:

- **Python** (≥ 3.7)
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **PyCharm** / **VS Code**
- **Data Handling & Processing:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - `Linear Regression`
  - `Random Forest`
  - `Gradient Boosting`
  - `XGBoost`
  - `CatBoost`
- **Model Explainability (for feature importance analysis):**
  - `SHAP`
  - `LIME`
- **Visualization Tools:**
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum:** 4GB RAM, Dual-core CPU
- **Recommended:** 8GB+ RAM, GPU (if using deep learning for insurance cost modeling)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nagavenkat1289/insurance-cost-prediction.git
   cd insurance-cost-prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data.
3. Train the model using different machine learning techniques.
4. Evaluate model performance and visualize feature importance.
5. Use the trained model to make insurance cost predictions.

## Model Explainability
- **SHAP:** Provides insights into how each feature impacts predictions.
- **LIME:** Explains individual predictions for better transparency.
